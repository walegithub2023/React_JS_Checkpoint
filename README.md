# NAME OF REPOSITORY: React_JS_Checkpoint



# DESCRIPTION: A repository for ReactJS Checkpoint. This repository houses a project made using ReactJS. The following are steps/instructions used to create the project.


    .Create a react-app using the command `npx create-react-app <project-name>` (make sure to replace <project-name> with your project name).

    .After creating the react-app, delete all files in the ‘src’ folder except for reportWebVitals.js and index.js

    .Create a new file called App.js containing this project's App component. Make sure to import everything you need to import, including react-bootstrap.

    .Check out the react-bootstrap documentation, go to the ‘Get Started’ webpage, and install and import the needed modules as specified in the steps.

    .Inside the App component, create a react fragment (search for react fragments and their uses), and create inside it a div with the className of “App.”

    .Inside the div, use react-bootstrap to create a navbar, a heading, and 3 cards (search for navbars, cards, and heading in react-bootstrap).

    .When you finish, run your project using the command `npm start.`
